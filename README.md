## üõ† Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/reapply.git
   cd reapply
   ```

2. **Install dependencies via CocoaPods:**
   ```bash
   pod install
   ```

3. **Open the workspace:**
   ```bash
   open Reapply.xcworkspace
   ```

4. **Configure API keys:**

   The app uses a property list file to store configurable keys such as third-party URLs and tokens.

   - Locate a file named `APIKeys.plist` in the project Configuration directory.
   - Fill in the appropriate values for your build environment (or leave blank to run with limited functionality).

### ‚òÅÔ∏è WeatherKit Integration (Required)

This project requires **WeatherKit** to function correctly.

- WeatherKit is used to access UV data essential to the app‚Äôs features.
- You must configure WeatherKit access through your own Apple Developer account to build and run the app properly.
- To enable WeatherKit:
  - Register your app‚Äôs Bundle Identifier with WeatherKit through the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/).
  - Ensure your Apple Developer account has an active WeatherKit subscription (free tier available).
  - Enable the WeatherKit capability in your Xcode project Signing & Capabilities settings.

Without properly configured WeatherKit access, the app will build but may not function correctly at runtime.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Code Signing and Cloud Services

Reapply uses features like iCloud and push notifications in the production App Store version.  
For this public repository:

- **iCloud services have been disabled** in the project settings to simplify local setup.
- You can build and run the app without needing an Apple Developer account or provisioning profile.
- If you wish to re-enable iCloud functionality, you must:
  - Add your own iCloud container in Apple Developer settings.
  - Update the entitlements file (`SPFReminder.entitlements`) accordingly.
  - Enable iCloud services under Signing & Capabilities.

This allows the public version to remain fully buildable without special configuration.
